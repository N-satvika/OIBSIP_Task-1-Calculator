# OIBSIP_Task-1-Calculator
In this project, we are going to discuss how to develop a Real-Time Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
If we observe any Real-Time Calculator It contains: 
Numbers(0-9 and 00)
Basic Arithmetic Operators like (+, -, *, /, %, )
And some special Symbol like (AC, DEL, Equal )
USE OF HTML:
In this program, we are using HTML to create content for the calculator which means we are creating boxes, input fields, Buttons, etc.
USE OF CSS:
We are using CSS for managing the content of HTML like the color, width, font-size, height, padding, margin, etc.
USE OF JAVASCRIPT:
It is used to perform operations of the calculator, like ARithmatic operations, clearing the input fields, backspace, displaying the output etc.
